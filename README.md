# Student Marks Prediction:

Welcome to the Student Marks Predictor project! This repository contains a comprehensive Python project developed to predict student marks based on their study hours. Utilizing machine learning techniques, particularly linear regression, this project aims to assist educators and students in understanding the correlation between study hours and academic performance.

## Features

- **Data Visualization**: Explore the dataset visually using matplotlib, gaining insights into the relationship between students' study hours and their marks.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values in the dataset with robust data cleaning techniques, ensuring data integrity and reliability.
- **Model Training**: Employ scikit-learn's LinearRegression model to train on the dataset, enabling accurate prediction of student marks.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the trained model using metrics such as the R-squared score, providing insights into the model's effectiveness.
- **Model Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune the trained model by visualizing the regression line on a scatter plot, enhancing predictive accuracy and reliability.
- **Model Persistence**: Save the trained machine learning model using joblib, facilitating future use and deployment in various applications.
